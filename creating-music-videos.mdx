Hedra allows you to create music videos in multiple ways depending on your creative goal.

This guide assumes you already have a finished song.

<video src="/videos/how-to-create-music-video.mp4" controls={true} />

There are three primary approaches:

- **A-Roll Only** – Performance-driven
- **B-Roll Only** – Cinematic or story-driven
- **A/B Mix** – Combined performance + visuals

Each method changes the tone and structure of your video.

## Understanding A-Roll vs B-Roll

Before building your video, it helps to understand the difference.

### A-Roll

A-Roll is your primary subject — usually the singer performing the song.

It focuses on:

- The artist
- Facial expression
- Lip syncing
- Direct performance energy

A-Roll keeps attention on the performer and is ideal for branding and connection.

---

### B-Roll

B-Roll supports the story or mood of the song.

It includes:

- Cinematic environments
- Story scenes
- Visual metaphors
- Atmosphere shots
- Abstract visuals

B-Roll adds depth and pacing but does not typically show the singer performing.

# Method 1: A-Roll Only (Avatar Performance)

Use this method when you want a performance-style music video focused entirely on the artist.

Best for:

- Lyric-heavy songs
- Artist branding
- Simple performance videos

---

## How It Works

1. Open **Avatar**
2. Upload an image of the singer
3. Upload your song as the audio source
4. Generate the video

Hedra will create a lip-synced performance based on the audio you provide.

The avatar’s mouth movement follows the song automatically.

---

## Lip Sync Notes

- Clear vocal audio produces better sync
- Avoid heavy distortion or layered effects in the vocal track
- Instrumentals and backing vocals are supported, but clarity improves realism

---

## Improving A-Roll

You can generate:

- Multiple angles of the singer
- Different wardrobe looks
- Different camera framings

Download multiple versions and cut between them in the Editor to create a more dynamic performance.

---

# Method 2: B-Roll Only (Cinematic Music Video)

Use this method when you want a fully visual narrative without showing the singer.

Best for:

- Concept videos
- Story-driven visuals
- Mood-based music
- Instrumental tracks

---

## How It Works

1. Open the **Editor**
2. Add your song to the **Audio Track**
3. Move along the timeline
4. Generate B-Roll directly onto the timeline
5. Arrange clips to match the song’s pacing

Generate visuals to match:

- Verse mood
- Chorus intensity
- Beat drops
- Instrumental transitions

This gives you full creative control over timing and structure.

---

# Method 3: A/B Mix (Performance + Cinematic)

This is the most common modern music video format.

It blends:

- A-Roll (singer performance)
- B-Roll (story or mood visuals)

---

## How It Works

1. Generate your A-Roll performance
2. Download or import it into the **Editor**
3. Add your song to the timeline
4. Generate B-Roll scenes
5. Cut between performance and visuals

Use A-Roll for:

- Verses
- Emotional delivery
- Close-up intensity

Use B-Roll for:

- Choruses
- Transitions
- Instrumentals
- Visual storytelling

## Choosing the Right Approach

| Goal                        | Recommended Method |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------- |

## Creative Tips

Hedra gives you flexibility.

You can create:

- A full performance

- Or a hybrid of both

The best approach depends on the tone of your song and the story you want to tell.
