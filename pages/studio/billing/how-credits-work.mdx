description: "Understanding Hedra's credit system for video, image, and audio generation"
---

Credits are the currency for generating video, image, or audio content across Hedra Studio's available models.

## Credit Usage by Content Type

### Video Generation

Video credits are deducted based on actual duration. If you generate a 10 second video with Character-3, you'll only be charged for 10 seconds of video—not for a full minute.

<Tip>
Check our [pricing page](https://hedra.com/plans) for current credit rates per model.
</Tip>

### Audio Generation

Audio uses a flat-rate billing model per 1,000 characters. The platform doesn't prorate character counts—meaning 1,001 characters and 1,999 characters would both incur the same credit charge.

<Info>
A character counter is available to help you track usage before generation.

### Image Generation

Image billing depends on the specific model, using either full-image or per-megapixel pricing structures. Higher resolutions typically cost more credits.

## Credit Rollover Policy

| Credit Type | Expiration |
|-------------|------------|
| Monthly subscription credits | Reset at each billing cycle (do not rollover) |
| Credit pack purchases | Never expire |

<Note>
Credits from credit pack purchases will persist across months and are consumed after your monthly allocation depletes.
</Note>

## Running Low on Credits?

If you run out of credits, you can:

1. **Upgrade your plan** - Get more monthly credits
2. **Purchase credit packs** - Buy additional one-time credits that never expire

## Auto-Recharge (API Users)

API users can enable auto-recharge with:
- Customizable trigger thresholds (minimum $10)
- Spending caps

Configure this in your Profile settings.

## Subscription Required

You need an active subscription to use credits. However, unused credits won't expire during inactive periods and become accessible upon resubscription.
