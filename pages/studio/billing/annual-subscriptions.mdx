Learn how credits are distributed and managed with annual subscriptions.

## Upfront Credit Distribution

When purchasing an annual subscription, **all yearly credits are issued immediately** upon payment rather than monthly.

<Info>
For example, a plan with 4,000 credits per month on an annual basis yields **all 48,000 credits** (4,000 × 12 months) immediately when you complete your purchase.

## Flexibility in Usage

Subscribers enjoy considerable discretion in managing their credit allocation:

- Consume the entire balance rapidly for a large project
- Distribute usage consistently throughout the year
- Adjust consumption based on seasonal demand fluctuations

<Note>
It's up to you to track your credit usage throughout the year for personal monthly budgeting purposes.

## Running Low on Credits

If you need more credits before your annual renewal, you have two options:

    Transition to a higher-tier subscription plan for more credits
  </Card>
  <Card title="Buy Credit Packs" icon="plus">
    Purchase supplementary one-time credit packages
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This approach allows you to align your spending strategy with your actual consumption requirements.
