    Click on the image, video, or audio file you wish to delete.

<Warning>
**Deletion is permanent.** We cannot recover deleted files. Make sure to download any content you want to keep before deleting.

## Bulk Deletion

The platform doesn't currently offer bulk deletion capabilities. The development team has indicated this feature is planned for future updates.

<Tip>
For now, you'll need to delete assets one at a time. Be sure to download important content before deleting.
