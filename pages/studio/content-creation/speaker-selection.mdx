Learn how to select which character speaks when using images with multiple characters.

## How Speaker Selection Works

When you have an image with multiple characters, Hedra allows you to designate which character will deliver the spoken audio.

## Steps to Select a Speaker

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Your Image">
    Upload or create your starting image containing multiple characters.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Speaker Selection">
    Click on the uploaded image and click the **Select Speaker** button that appears in the bar in the middle of the screen when you hover over the image.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mark the Speaking Character">
    Position the green smiley icon on your chosen character by dragging and expanding it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Video">
    Proceed with video creation - the marked character will animate according to your audio input, whether speaking or singing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Once you've marked a character using the green smiley indicator, that character will be the one performing the audio you provide.

<Tip>
This feature works for both speaking and singing content, so you can create music videos with specific characters performing.
