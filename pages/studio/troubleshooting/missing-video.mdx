title: "Video Missing After Credits Deducted"

If your credits were deducted but you can't find your finished video, don't worry—it may have completed successfully.

## Why This Happens

The main page sometimes resets after generation, particularly if you:
- Were away for an extended period
- Closed the browser tab
- Experienced a network interruption

The video may have actually completed successfully and moved to your Library.

## How to Find Your Video

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the Library">
    Navigate to your [Library](https://hedra.com/app/library) to see if your completed video appears there.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Look for Recent Generations">
    Your history retains finished videos even if the interface has refreshed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Before regenerating a video, always check your Library first to avoid duplicate credit charges.
</Tip>

## If You Still Can't Find It

If the video doesn't appear in your Library and you suspect a generation error occurred:

1. **Contact Support** at [hedra.com/support](https://hedra.com/support)
2. **Include a screenshot** of your Library view
3. **Note the approximate timestamp** of when you initiated the video creation

This information helps the team investigate and resolve the issue, including potential credit refunds if applicable.
