    Click on the uploaded image and click the "Select Speaker" button that appears when you hover over the image.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mark the Character">
    Position the green smiley icon on your chosen character by dragging and expanding it. This character will animate according to your audio input.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once you've marked a character using the green smiley indicator, proceed with video creation and that character will be the one performing the audio you provide.
