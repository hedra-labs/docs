If you have a starting image with multiple characters, Hedra has a tool that lets you select which character will be talking.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click to Add Start Frame">
    Upload or create the starting image with multiple characters. You can pick from ****Generate, Upload, Take Photo ****or****Library****  .
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the speaker">
    Next to the uploaded image, click the **Select Speaker** button <Icon icon="user-large" /> on the bar by the <Icon icon="trash-can" /> trash can.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Position the speaker indicator">
    On your image, drag and then expand the green smiley icon <Icon icon="face-smile" /> on the character you want to speak. From there, continue creating the video — the selected character will be the one to speak, sing, etc. based on your audio input.
