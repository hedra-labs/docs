## 1. Add a Start Frame

Upload or create a starting image that contains multiple characters.

You can choose from:

- **Generate**
- **Upload**
- **Take Photo**
- **Library**

---

## 2. Select the Speaker

Next to the uploaded image:

1. Click **Select Speaker** <Icon icon="user" />\
   (the person icon on the image toolbar, next to the trash icon)

---

## 3. Position the Speaker Indicator

On the image:

1. Drag the green <Icon icon="face-smile" /> onto the character you want to speak
2. Resize the indicator box if needed
3. Continue creating your video

The selected character will be the one who speaks, sings, or performs based on your audio input.
