## What Are Elements?

Elements are pre-configured visual pieces you can use to define creative building blocks like:

- Character styles and poses
- Visual environments
- Clothing or outfit options
- Visual themes
- Custom branded assets

They help you avoid “blank slate paralysis” by giving you a tangible visual starting point instead of starting from generic text. You can mix and match Elements with your own uploads or generated content to speed up creation, eliminate guesswork, and reduce prompt fatigue.

## When Should You Use Elements?

Use Elements when you:

- Want a consistent character or style base
- Don’t want to write detailed prompts from scratch
- Are iterating content quickly
- Need visual inspiration
- Want reusable components for a series of videos
