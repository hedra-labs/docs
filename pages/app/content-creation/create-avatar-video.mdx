On the home page, select **Avatar** from the tool section at the top of the page, or from the **+** icon in the sidebar on desktop.

You can choose from a variety of models in the bottom-left model selector to get exactly the animation you are going for.

<Tip>
  For help choosing the right model, see [Which Video Model Should I Use?](/pages/help/getting-started/video-models).
