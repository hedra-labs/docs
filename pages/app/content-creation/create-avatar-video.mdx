This guide walks you through the full process: image → audio → video.

---

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:

- An image (uploaded or generated in Hedra)
- Audio (uploaded, recorded, or AI-generated)
- Access to video generation inside Hedra Studio

---

## Step 1: Upload or Generate an Image

1. Open **Avatar App**
2. Click **Add Start Frame.** **Upload**, **Take Photo**, access your **Library** or **Generate** one using an image model.
3. Confirm the image is centered and clearly framed.

> Tip: Front-facing portraits produce the most natural speaking results.

## Step 2: Add Audio

You can add audio in three ways:

- Upload an existing audio file
- Record your voice directly in Hedra
- Generate AI voice using supported voice models

1. Navigate to the [**Audio**](https://www.hedra.com/app/audio) section
2. Upload or generate your audio
3. Preview playback to confirm clarity

> Clear audio improves lip-sync accuracy.

## Step 3: Select an Avatar Video Model

1. Go to the [**Video Generation**](https://www.hedra.com/app/video) section
2. Choose an avatar video model
3. Confirm image and audio are both attached

---

## Step 4: Generate the Video

1. Click **Generate**
2. Wait for processing to complete
3. Preview the result
4. Download or regenerate if needed

## Best Practices

- Use high-resolution images
- Avoid extreme angles or heavy shadows
- Keep audio clean and evenly paced
- Start with short clips when testing

## Troubleshooting

### The lips don’t match the audio

- Check for background noise
- Ensure the audio file is clear and not distorted

### The face looks unnatural

- Use a well-lit, front-facing image
- Avoid heavy filters or stylization

### The video failed to generate

- Confirm both image and audio are attached
- Try regenerating
