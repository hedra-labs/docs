Use **Video Upscaling** to increase the resolution and detail of your video outputs.\
Upscaling makes videos sharper, improves clarity, and enhances visual quality — especially when exporting for larger displays.

## What Upscaling Does

Video upscaling:

- Increases resolution (e.g., 720p → 1080p)
- Improves visual detail
- Reduces blur in motion
- Enhances fine features

Upscaling applies an AI-based enhancement step after your video is generated.

## When to Use Upscale

Use Upscale when:

✔ You want higher resolution output\
✔ You are preparing content for large screens\
✔ Your original video is low resolution\
✔ You want smoother, clearer visuals

Upscaling is optional — use it only when you need a higher fidelity result.

## How to Upscale a Video

Follow these steps:

### 1. Open the Video You Want to Upscale

Go to your **Studio** or **Video Library**, and open the video you want to improve.

---

### 2. Click **Upscale**

Within the video controls, select the **Upscale** option.

This opens the upscaling interface.

---

### 3. Choose Upscale Settings

- Select the **Target Resolution**\
  (e.g., 1080p, 2K, 4K)
- Select the **Upscale Model** (if available)

Higher resolutions offer better quality but may take longer to process.

---

### 4. Start the Upscale

Click **Generate** or **Start Upscale**.

The system will process the original video to create a new, upscaled version.

Processing time varies based on:

- Original resolution
- Target resolution
- Video length

---

### 5. Review and Download

Once complete:

- Preview the upscaled video
- Download or export the result
- Compare with the original if needed

---

## Tips for Best Results

- Use source videos with clear frames
- Avoid upscaling extremely low-res clips too far up (e.g., 240p → 4K)
- Upscaling works best when the original quality is moderately high

---

## Common Issues

**Upscaled video looks blurry**\
➡ Upscaling cannot add detail that doesn’t exist in the source. Start with the highest quality original possible.

**Upscale takes a long time**\
➡ Higher target resolutions require more processing.

**Video artifacts appear**\
➡ Try a lower upscale target or regenerate.

## What Happens After Upscaling

An upscaled video becomes a **separate output file** from the original.\
Your original stays unchanged in the library.
