## How Assets Are Organized

Your Library includes the following categories:

- **All** – Every asset in your account
- **Video** – Generated video files
- **Image** – Uploaded and generated images
- **Audio** – Uploaded or generated audio files
- **Elements** – Saved characters, styles, environments, and outfits
- **Favorites** – Assets you’ve marked for quick access

Use these filters to quickly narrow down content.

## Managing Your Assets

Inside the Library, you can:

- Preview assets
- Download files
- Reuse assets in new projects
- Delete unwanted content

---

## Using Assets in New Projects

You can reuse Library items when creating new content.

For example:

- Select an image from **Image** to use as a start frame

The Library acts as your central workspace for all reusable content.
