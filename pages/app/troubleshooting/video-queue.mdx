When using Hedra with a free plan, you may experience longer wait times while your video is being processed. This is caused by:

- High demand for video creation from all users
- A queueing system that prioritizes paid users
- Queues that can exceed 1,000+ videos awaiting processing

Video processing wait times can take up to several hours depending on the queue length.

<Tip>
  To achieve faster processing times, consider [upgrading your account](https://hedra.com/plans) to a paid plan.
