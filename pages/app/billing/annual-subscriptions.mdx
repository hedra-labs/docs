When you purchase an annual subscription, all your credits for the entire year are provided upfront at the time of payment, rather than being distributed monthly.

## Credit Distribution

For example, if you subscribe to a plan that includes 4,000 credits per month on an annual basis, you'll receive all 48,000 credits (4,000 x 12 months) immediately when you complete your purchase.

## Credit Usage

You have complete flexibility in how you use your annual credit allotment:

- Use all credits as quickly as you need them
- Spread them out evenly throughout the year
- Use more credits during busy periods and fewer during slower times

<Note>
  It's up to you to track your credit usage throughout the year if you'd prefer a set monthly allotment.
</Note>

## Getting Additional Credits

If you find yourself running low on credits before your annual subscription renews, you have two options:

- **Upgrade** to a higher-tier plan at [hedra.com/plans](https://hedra.com/plans)
- **Purchase** a one-time credit pack
