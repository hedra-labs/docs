You can cancel your subscription directly from your [account billing settings](https://www.hedra.com/app/settings/billing).

Canceling your subscription will stop billing while keeping your account active, allowing you to continue using any remaining benefits until your current billing period ends.

## What happens after cancellation?

When you cancel your subscription:

- Billing stops immediately
- Your account remains active
- You can continue using subscription credits and benefits until the current billing period ends
- You can reactivate your subscription anytime through the same billing section

<Note>
  Canceling your subscription is different from deleting your account. Your account will remain active even after cancellation.
