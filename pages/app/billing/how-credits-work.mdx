description: "Understanding how credits are used for video, image, and audio generation in Hedra."
---

Credits are a unit of work that can be used for video, image, or audio generation with any model available in Hedra Studio.

## Video credits

Credits are deducted based on the generated video length. For example, if you generate a 10-second video with Character-3, you'll only be charged for 10 seconds of video and not for a full minute.

See the most up-to-date video credit rates [here](https://www.hedra.com/plans#:~:text=Credits-,Video,-Action).

## Audio credits

Credits are billed on a flat rate of 1 per 55 characters. You'll see a character counter underneath the text box so you can always keep an eye on character count. The generate button will update in realtime showing what the script will cost.

## Image credits

Credits are billed either based on a full image generation or by megapixel, depending on the model.

<Note>
  At this time you won't see an estimated credit cost for models that are billed on a per-megapixel basis, though you can assume the higher the resolution you select the higher the credit cost.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do credits roll over from month to month?">
    Credits from your monthly subscription do not carry over between billing cycles. At the start of each cycle, your monthly credits will reset to your plan's designated amount. Any credits from credit pack purchases, however, will not expire.

  <Accordion title="What happens if I run out of credits?">
    If you use up your monthly credits, you can get additional credits either by upgrading your plan or by purchasing credit packs. Click on your credits and select either **Upgrade Plan** or **Purchase Credit Packs**. Credits from credit packs will be used after your monthly plan credits are depleted, and unused credit pack credits will roll over between billing cycles.
