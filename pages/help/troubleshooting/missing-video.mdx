title: "Missing Video After Credits Deducted"
description: "What to do when credits were deducted but your video doesn't appear on screen."

If you notice that credits were deducted from your account but you don't see a completed video on your main page, the video may have actually completed successfully and moved to your Library.

## Check your Library

Before recreating the video, check your [Library](https://www.hedra.com/app/library) to see if your video appears there. Sometimes the main page will reset after video generation — especially if you step away or close the tab — but the completed video will be available in your history.

If you still don't see your video in the Library, please contact support with:

- A screenshot of your Library
- A general timestamp for when you created the video

This helps us investigate further and resolve the issue.
