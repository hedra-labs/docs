description: "How to collect browser console logs and HAR files to help troubleshoot issues."
---

Console logs and HAR files help the Hedra team see errors we can't reproduce and diagnose problems quickly.

- **Console Logs** — A record of what your browser is reporting behind the scenes (errors, warnings, etc.)
- **HAR File** — A timeline of all the network requests your browser made while the issue happened

## Before You Start

- Close other tabs that aren't needed to reduce noise
- Reproduce the problem only after you've opened the tools below so we capture everything
- These files only show what happened in the tab you're recording

## Sending the Files

Attach the required files (`console-log.txt` and/or `network-log.har`) to your support ticket with Hedra. Include a quick note describing what you were doing when the issue happened.

<Warning>
  HAR files can include request URLs and form data you entered on the captured page. If there's anything sensitive, let the support team know — they can guide you on redacting it or send a secure upload link.
</Warning>
