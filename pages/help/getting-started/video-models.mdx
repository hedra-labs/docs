## Hedra Avatar — 4–6 credits/sec

**Best for:** Talking heads, hosts, explainers, lip sync, podcasts, tutorials, and any A-roll where lip-sync and performance matter.

**Shines at:**
- Native audio support in Hedra (unique among these models)
- Crisp lip-sync, expressive emotion, and full-body nuance
- Perfect for tutorials, spokesperson content, and storytelling

<Tip>
  Character-3 also runs at **540p for 3 credits/sec** — a great way to try things out quickly and cost-effectively before moving to higher res.
</Tip>

**Watch-outs:** Not intended for action set-pieces or large physics-driven scenes. Think "talent in front of the camera," not explosions.

## Veo 3 — 100 credits/sec

**Best for:** Cinematic, photoreal B-roll or short creative shots.

**Shines at:** Extremely high realism, natural physics, strong prompt adherence, and beautiful cinematic motion.

**Watch-outs:** Multi-shot character consistency can be tricky; generally works best as standalone clips. Limited to 8-second clips.

## Veo 3 Fast — 55 credits/sec

**Best for:** Rapid iteration and concepting with "Veo-like" quality at lower cost.

**Shines at:** Speed and efficiency while keeping much of Veo's look.

**Watch-outs:** Slight trade-offs in fidelity and subtle detail compared to full Veo 3. Also limited to 8 seconds.

## MiniMax Hailou-02 Pro — 16 credits/sec

**Best for:** Physics-heavy motion (splashes, cloth, diving, dynamic stunts) in sharp 1080p.

**Shines at:** Believable physical effects, clean motion, and cinematic feeling.

**Watch-outs:** Often dramatic by default — great for action, less so for subtle character work.

## MiniMax Hailou-02 (Standard) — 8 credits/sec

**Best for:** Budget-friendly social clips and quick motion tests.

**Shines at:** Smooth, natural motion for cost.

**Watch-outs:** Lower resolution/detail than Pro.

## Kling 2.1 Master — 35 credits/sec

**Best for:** Premium 1080p clips with complex motion and higher semantic fidelity.

**Shines at:** Polished results, strong prompt following, good balance of realism and flexibility.

**Watch-outs:** More expensive tier, mainly worth it if you need maximum polish.

## Kling 2.1 Pro — 15 credits/sec

**Best for:** Cost-effective 720p/1080p videos where efficiency matters most.

**Shines at:** Faster, affordable clips with good action and style.

**Watch-outs:** Less subtlety and stability than Master.
