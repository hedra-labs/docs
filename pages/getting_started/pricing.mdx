description: "Understand Hedra API pricing and credit usage"
---

Hedra uses a credit-based system for API usage. This guide explains how credits work and helps you estimate costs for your projects.

## How Credits Work

Credits are consumed each time you generate a video through the API. The cost depends on:

- **Video duration** - Longer videos use more credits
- **Resolution** - Higher resolutions (720p vs 540p) use more credits
- **Model version** - Character-3 and Character-2 have different pricing
