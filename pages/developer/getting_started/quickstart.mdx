Access almost all of the world's leading image, video, and audio models — including Nano Banana Pro, Veo, Grok, Kling, and more — via the Hedra API, using the same account your team uses to create content on the Hedra platform.

### Step 1: Purchase a paid account

In order to use our API, you'll need a paid subscription account. You can purchase your plans at https://www.hedra.com/plans.

### Step 2: Register an API key

Go to your [profile](https://hedra.com/api-profile), click to generate an API key, and purchase API credits.

### Step 3: Make your first API call

Set your API key and list available models:

```bash
export HEDRA_API_KEY="your_api_key"

curl https://api.hedra.com/web-app/public/models \
  -H "X-API-Key: $HEDRA_API_KEY"
```
