## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Hedra?">
    Hedra is a generative AI platform that creates realistic talking avatar videos. Our APIs let you generate videos by combining a portrait image with audio - the AI handles lip sync, facial expressions, and natural head movement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What can I build with Hedra?">
    Common use cases include:
    - Personalized marketing videos at scale
    - E-learning and training content
    - Social media content (TikTok, Reels, Shorts)
    - Virtual assistants and chatbots with video
    - Customer support video libraries
    - Multi-language video localization
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Character API and Live Avatar?">
    **Character API** generates pre-rendered videos - you upload assets and download a finished video file. Best for content creation workflows.

    **Live Avatar** provides real-time streaming - the avatar responds immediately to audio input via WebRTC. Best for interactive applications like chatbots or live experiences.
