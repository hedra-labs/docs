Get up and running in minutes using create-hedra-avatar.
> **⚠️ Before you begin:**
> Please make sure you have completed the [Get Started](./get-started) section first to set up all required API keys and environment variables.


---
1. **Create your application (replace &lt;app-name&gt; with your desired name):**

```sh
npx @hedra/create-hedra-avatar <app-name>
```

> **Note:** Make sure you have `pnpm` installed:

```sh
# Homebrew
brew install pnpm
# or
npm install -g pnpm
```

> You might need to use a virtual environment when installing dependencies using pip. You must use Python version >3.10. (If you change your Python version after creating a virtual environment, delete the `venv` directory and recreate it with the correct Python version)

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

> If you see an error about a missing dependency you can now install it with `pip`:

```sh
# Example
pip install dotenv
```

2. **Navigate to your application directory:**

```sh
cd <app-name>
```

3. **Create `.env.local` in both frontend and backend directories and copy the contents of the `.env` file created earlier:**

```sh
cp ~/<path-to-your-env-file>/.env ./frontend/.env.local
cp ~/<path-to-your-env-file>/.env ./backend/.env.local
```

4. **Start the agent:**

```sh
npm run start-agent
```

5. **Start the application (in a new terminal with the same virtual environment activated):**

```sh
npm run start-app
```

> **Note:** Make sure you have Node.js installed:

```sh
brew install node
```

> Install any missing packages:

```sh
npm install
```
