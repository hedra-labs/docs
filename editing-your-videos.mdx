## Overview

This tutorial introduces Composer, Hedra’s built-in video editor, and shows how to assemble generated clips into a finished video.

Composer is designed to take the outputs from your generations — including characters, environments, Elements, and voiceover — and turn them into a cohesive, platform-ready piece. Rather than regenerating content repeatedly, Composer allows you to refine structure, pacing, and flow using the material you’ve already created.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:

- Import generated clips into the timeline
- Arrange clips into a clear sequence or composition
- Trim and adjust timing for better pacing
- Combine multiple scenes into a single narrative flow
- Integrate voiceover and mute or manage original audio
- Export a finalized video suitable for social or Learn content

The focus is on understanding how to move from raw generation to intentional editing. Composer is where structure and storytelling take shape — allowing you to control rhythm, clarity, and emphasis without returning to the generation step.

This walkthrough is ideal for users who want to turn their AI-generated assets into finished videos efficiently and with greater creative control.
